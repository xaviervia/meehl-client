========================================

Scores
------

### Economy

Clients should be able to afford the service, otherwise you are doing charity,  not business.

### Commitment

Committed clients are ready at hand for any feedback or special resources needed for the project completion. Lack of commitment from the client is deadly to most projects.

### Experience

Unexperienced clients have to be educated about the industry constantly and will make rookie mistakes. Lack of experience working with providers is a major red flag for large projects.
